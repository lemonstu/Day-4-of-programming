# Day-4-of-programming
What I've learnt in the past 4 days:
1.Functions (Python) - what the fuuuuck??? this is incredible. Functions are the collest shit I've ever encountered - what the hell have I been doing for 41 years. I was too fucking dumb, blind and confused.

I want to know as much as possible - I just can't stop digging - Computer Science is super duper AWESOME.

It gets tougher, though. I mean, the amount of mistakes I'm making is incredible.

Need to constantly practicve it 

2. Lists - easy. the only annoying thing are the parentases - if only it was making autocorrect suggestions.... hmmmm. like excel does aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh
but nah.... it's ok - gotta get used to it - it's part of the game - you gotta make mistakes because one thing about this beautiful science is:

TREAT IT AS A GAME WITH NEW LEVELS EVERYTIME - JUST LIKE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES - SAME MINDSET

I don't know why... but I feel like I've found my destiny

Data science is the direction - I hope to learn it by June 2020, so I could start working - got a family to feed. For 3.5 months no one ever called me for an interview.

This is truly my last shot...

Thanks GitHub - you guys got me writing the diary of my travel into Computer Science land... what a perfect world it is -

LET LOGIC RULE
